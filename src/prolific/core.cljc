  "Portable Prolific domain logic — reward arithmetic, filter resolution,
  study payload construction, submission triage.

  Everything here is pure: it takes already-fetched data and returns data.
  The HTTP side lives in `prolific.client`. That split is the point — the
  parts worth getting right (what a participant is paid, which population is
  recruited, which submissions get money) are the parts you want to test
  without a network or a token."

;; ---------------------------------------------------------------- rewards

;; Prolific's own recommended rate is USD 12.00/hour; the hard floor is 8.00.
;; Defaulting to the floor buys rushed, resentful participants and unusable
;; free text, which is a false economy on a study whose entire output is
;; written answers.
(def default-hourly-usd 12.00)

;; Corporate platform fee. Academic/non-profit is 33.3%.
(def default-fee-rate 0.428)

;; Money is computed in integer cents, never in floating point.
;;
;; This is not stylistic. The first version used `(* 100 hourly (/ minutes 60))`
;; and the JVM evaluated it to 200.00000000000006 where JS got exactly 200 —
;; so `Math/ceil` crossed to the next 5c bracket on one host and not the
;; other, and the same study paid $2.05 under `clojure` and $2.00 under `nbb`.
;; A reward that depends on which runtime happened to build the payload is a
;; bug you find in a participant's complaint, not in a test.

  do this job picked the wrong filter against the live API — a defect no
  fixture could show, since the fixture had four filters and the account has
  491.

  It scanned title/question/description for \"language\" and then for
  \"fluent\", and `english-speaking-monolingual` (index 303) matched both: its
  question reads \"are you fluent only in English?\". `fluent-languages` sits
  at index 388 and was never reached. The chosen filter's options are
  monolingualism categories — \"I only know English\", \"I know one other
  language…\" — so no language matched and `resolve-languages` returned
  `:unmatched` for all five requested languages.

  The invariant held: an unmatched language is reported, never dropped, so
  this surfaced as a refusal rather than as a study recruiting the wrong
  population. But live language resolution did not work at all.

  The text heuristic survives as a last resort, now gated on
  `language-choices?` so a filter that only talks about languages cannot win
