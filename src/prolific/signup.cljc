  "The Prolific researcher signup as data: steps, fields, and who may fill
  each one.

  The step list is transcribed from a real traversal on 2026-07-30, not from
  Prolific's docs — the flow is a single route (`/register/researcher/email`)
  that advances by fragment (`#country`, `#professional_profile`), which
  matters because it means the URL alone is weak evidence of progress (see
  `prolific.evidence/navigated?`).

  Why the human/machine split is four categories and not two
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  Lumping every human-only field under \"needs a human\" hides the only
  distinction worth acting on. Three of these can never be automated, and
  one is simply data nobody has written down yet:

    :human/credential   passwords. A permanent boundary.
    :human/captcha      bot-detection. A permanent boundary.
    :human/consent      terms, marketing opt-in, cookie banners. A consent
                        is given by a person; an agent cannot hold it.
    :human/unknown-fact country of residence. NOT a boundary — the run
                        stopped because nobody had stated the value, and it
                        becomes machine-fillable the moment the profile
                        carries it.

  Conflating the fourth with the first three is what makes an onboarding
  runner look permanently 60% manual when it is actually 80% automatable
  with two more lines of config. `gaps` reports exactly that difference.

  Pure: takes a profile map, returns a plan."
