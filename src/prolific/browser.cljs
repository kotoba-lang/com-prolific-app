  "Drive a browser form through agent-browser (CDP), verifying every write.

  Why this channel and not the desktop
  ------------------------------------
  Choosing a DOM-level channel does not merely make failures *detectable*,
  it makes two of them *impossible*. Measured against a fixture form on
  2026-07-30, in the same session where synthetic keystrokes had just
  corrupted the real one:

    fill \"Research Operations\" -> read back \"Research Operations\"
      (the keystroke channel lost the last 4 characters)
    fill \"User Research\" over it -> read back \"User Research\"
      (the keystroke channel had produced \"Research OperationsUser Research\")

  `fill` clears then writes atomically, so `:truncated` and `:appended` from
  `prolific.evidence` cannot occur here. `get value` supplies the read-back
  those verdicts are computed from. That is the entire argument for this
  namespace.

  Advancing a step is a separate, named act
  ----------------------------------------
  `advance!` exists but refuses by default. A step whose Next button carries
  an agreement (`signup/may-advance?` false — the Prolific email step is one:
  there is no terms checkbox, the button IS the agreement) can only be
  advanced by naming the exact consent being given and who gave it.

  An earlier version of this namespace simply had no advance function at all.
  That read as safe and was worse: it left the only way forward outside the
  code, so an advance that a person did authorise happened through a raw CLI
  call and left no record of what was agreed to. Refusing is not the goal —
  recording is. The refusal is the default, not the ceiling.

  Nothing here fills a password or answers a CAPTCHA. Those are not defaults
  that authorisation can lift.

  nbb / Node only. The decisions live in the pure namespaces."

  Prolific's Sector field is the second kind — an Element-UI `INPUT` with
  `aria-haspopup=listbox` — so `select` writes nothing and reports success.
  The native path is tried first and, when the read-back says `:unchanged`,
  the listbox path is tried. That is not a retry: `:unchanged` asks for a
  different technique, and repeating the same one is what `evidence` forbids.

  The label is resolved from the live snapshot so a profile can name what a
  person sees (`\"Industry\"`, not `industry`), and an unmatched label is
  reported with the real ones — a caller told only \"it didn't work\" cannot
  fix a typo.

  `field-label` exists so the read-back can RE-RESOLVE the control instead of
  reusing `sel`. Opening the popup renumbers the ref table, so the `sel` this
  was called with may no longer be the combobox by the time there is
