  "An action's return value is not evidence that the action happened.

  This namespace exists because of measured failures, not caution. Driving
  the Prolific researcher signup form on 2026-07-30 produced three reports
  of success with nothing behind them:

    type   -> \"Typed\"                 4 characters were silently dropped
    key    -> \"Pressed tab\"           focus never moved, so the next value
                                        was concatenated onto the previous field
    resize -> \"after=622,-1049,...\"   the window had not moved one pixel;
                                        the tool echoed the requested bounds

  Each was indistinguishable from success at the call site. The only thing
  that caught them was reading the target's own state back afterwards. So a
  step is complete when an independent read-back matches the intent — never
  because the actuator said so.

  The verdict taxonomy is not decoration. Each verdict has a DIFFERENT
  repair, and picking the wrong one is how the form got worse instead of
  better: a truncated field looks like it needs the missing suffix typed,
  and typing the suffix is exactly what corrupted it a second time.

  Pure: takes three strings, returns data."

  `:before` is required for the two verdicts that matter most. Without it
