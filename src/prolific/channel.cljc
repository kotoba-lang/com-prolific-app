  "Which automation channel may drive a form, decided BEFORE touching it.

  On 2026-07-30 the Prolific signup form was driven through synthetic
  keystrokes because the two better channels turned out to be unavailable —
  but that was discovered one field at a time, by corrupting the form:

    accessibility  Chrome's web content was an AXGroup 500x547 with zero
                   children (renderer accessibility off), so no field could
                   be addressed by label
    coordinate     the window sat on a second display at y=-1049 while the
                   click space was the primary display only
    keystroke      the only channel left — and it dropped characters and
                   swallowed a Tab, concatenating two field values

  The keystroke channel's defect is not flakiness, it is structural: it
  cannot read a field back, so it can never produce the evidence
  `prolific.evidence` requires. A channel that cannot be verified is refused
  even when it is the only one available. Refusing means the run stops with
  the form untouched, which is strictly better than the half-filled form
  that a best-effort attempt actually produced.

  Pure: takes observed capabilities, returns a decision."
